# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. This single page project displays tweets input by the user. It contains two pre-created tweets.

This project was built from starter code provided by Lighthouse Labs. HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX was used for the front-end, and Node and Express were used for the back-end.
